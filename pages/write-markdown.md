# Write Talk Summaries

Talk summaries can be written in Markdown. Currently, the flavor of Markdown
we use is Julia flavored markdown.

A few of the details about Julia flavored markdown:

- Enclose inline math like ``` ``x = \frac{a}{b}`` ```. We support a large
  amount of LaTeX, including the AMS math libraries.
- Enclose block math using

`````md
```math
x = \frac{a}{b}
```
`````

Otherwise, consult a guide on markdown. You can submit talk summaries to any of
the organizers, or directly submit a Pull Request on GitHub.
