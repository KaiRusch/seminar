We all know that ``\mathrm{i}^2=-1``. But what if it werenâ€™t? This talk
explores generalizations of the complex numbers.

### Outline

- Rotation dilation matrices in two dimensions
- Complex geometry
- General ``2\times2`` real matrices
- Geometry of the split-complex numbers
- Geometry of the dual numbers
- Equivalence of hypercomplex number algebras up to isomorphism
- The general linear group ``\mathsf{GL}(2, \mathbb{R})``
- Generalization to ``n`` dimensions
