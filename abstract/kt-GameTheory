A game is a “mathematical model between interacting decision makers” where each
player must make choices based on a set of rules. Every individual in a game
must also have a preferred reaction to any combination of actions taken by
other agents.  Game theory is about the study and application of these models.
It involves various solution concepts and methods that can be employed to
predict the outcomes of strategic engagements.  This talk will introduce the
major ideas in the field. There will be a focus on basic definitions, types of
games, and how we can “solve games” using the Nash equilibrium. Hopefully we’ll
get to “play” some ourselves. Towards the end, we can also review some neat
unsolved problems in game theory that are very easy to understand, but prove
really difficult to solve.
