Wednesday October 12 2016 in MC 4020 Abstract This talk will cover the basics of group theory There are no official prerequisites for this talk but MATH 145 and MATH 146 are an asset The group theory part of the talk will mostly be based on Alekseev 2004 specifically sections 11 40motivation41 12 40transformation groups41 15 19 and 113 40various morphisms41 and 111 40quotient groups41 Due to time constraints it is inevitable that some content must be rushed I will not go over proofs and derivations in full rigour and I highly advise studying the reference material after the talk to catch up on what you may have missed Please message me in advance if there are any other subjects in particular that you would like me to discuss This talk on Algebra covers material that may be important for future talks Abstract Algebra Algebra is about structure and maps that preserve structure In mathematics we investigate particular sets and how they behave Many results on certain sets actually apply to a wide class of sets Algebra allows us to generalize these results We investigate sets and their structures by appealing to fundamental structural properties This investigation leads to the revelation that certain kinds of structure are especially prevalent and useful In MATH 136 or MATH 146 we have seen fields and vector spaces which are a particularly important sort of structure Today I will be talking about another useful sort of structure the group Binary Operators and Distinguished Elements What do I mean by ltqgtstructureltqgt There are two common forms of structure binary operators and distinguished elements Given a set 36S36 we call a function 36f Stimes Sto S36 a binary operator Binary operators are typically written in infix notation that is we write 36afb36 instead of 36f40a b4136 Furthermore we often use symbols such as 364336 3636 3636 3636 or similar for these operators Conventionally we may omit certain binary operators such as the 3636 for function composition or the 3636 for multiplication That is we may write 36ab36 to denote 36ab36 A ltqgtdistinguished elementltqgt of 36S36 is simply a specific element 36xin S36 that satisfies certain properties usually in relation to binary operators Example Consider the set of real functions defined everywhere which I will denote as 36mathbf123R125mathbf123R12536 What sort of structure can we find in this set Let39s focus on binary operations One obvious binary operation is 3636 which represents function composition We define 3640f g4140x41 61 f40g40x414136 The first property we note is that composition is associative that is for all real functions 36f36 36g36 and 36h36 we have 3640f g41 h 61 x f40g40h40x414141 61 f 40g h4136 For associative binary operations we frequently omit the parentheses That is we may simply write 36f g h36 Next we note that there is a distinguished element of 36S36 which we will name 36I36 with the property that for all 36x36 36I40x41 61 x36 This 36I36 is frequently known as the ltqgtidentity functionltqgt It happens to be the identity element of the 3636 operation that is for all 36fin S36 we have 36I f 61 f I 61 f36 Monoids A monoid is a set 36S36 with distinguished element 36ein S36 together with a binary operation 36 Stimes Sto S36 such that 3636 is associative and 36e36 is an identity element of the 3636 operation or more formally 3640ab41c 61 a40bc4136 for all 36abcin S36 36ea61ae61a36 for all 36ain S36 An example of a monoid is the set of strings under binary operator concatenation with identity element the empty string 3636 They are very closely related to monads a concept seen in category theory and computer science Example Consider again the set of real functions defined everywhere This time consider the subset 3636 of bijective real functions Since the composition of bijections remains a bijection we see that this set is still a monoid under function composition 3636 But indeed there is more structure to be explored here Every bijection 36in36 admits an inverse 36123112536 The crucial property of the inverse is that 36123112561123112561I36 where 36I36 is the identity element of the 3636 operation Such an algebraic structure a monoid with inverses is called a ltqgtgroupltqgt The particular group of bijections seen above is called a ltqgtsymmetric groupltqgt Groups A group is a set 36S36 with distinguished element 36ein S36 together with a binary operation 36 Stimes Sto S36 such that 3636 is associative 36e36 is an identity element of the 3636 operation every element has an inverse or more formally 3640ab41c 61 a40bc4136 for all 36abcin S36 36ea61ae61a36 for all 36ain S36 for all 36ain S36 there is 36a1231125in S36 with 36aa123112561a1231125a61e36 It is easy to prove although we will not do it that the identity of a group is unique and that each element has a unique inverse element An example of a group is the integers under operation 364336 This associative binary operation is in fact also commutative 40that is 36a43b61b43a36 for all integers 36a36 and 36b3641 Groups where the associative binary operation is also commutative are called abelian groups As a notational convenience the 364336 operator is conventionally reserved for abelian groups Note that the integers under operation 3636 do not form a group because 36036 does not admit an inverse StructurePreserving Maps A morphism between algebraic structures 36G36 and 36H36 is a map 36f Gto H36 that preserves some kind of structure In particular we define a homomorphism between groups as a map that preserves the associative binary operation 40From this it follows that the inverse is also preserved41 By this we mean that if 36abin G36 then 36f40a41f40b41 61 f40ab4136 Note that there is no requirement that the operation 36f36 be invertible indeed the map 36x 036 from the group of integers under addition to itself is a homomorphism We define monomorphism to be a onetoone homomorphism and an epimorphism to be an onto homomorphism A fact that we will not prove 40but is easy to show41 is that the nullspace of a monomorphism is the singleton set containing the identity element of 36G36 A group isomorphism is a onetoone and onto homomorphism Group isomorphisms admit inverse maps Of course these terms are also applicable beyond groups for monoids graphs vector spaces etc the various morphisms preserve the respective algebraic structures Subgroups Recall that in MATH 136 or MATH 146 we had the concept of subspaces A subspace of a vector space 36V36 could be constructed by taking a subset 36W V36 which forms a vector space in its own right under the same operations addition 364336 and scalar multilpication 3636 as 36V36 In other words when we restricted the operations of 36V36 to subset 36W36 and the resulting space remains a vector space then 36W36 is a subspace of 36V36 We can similarly define a subgroup 36H36 of 36G36 to be a subset of elements of 36G36 together with the associative binary operation 3636 of 36G36 such that 3640H 4136 4036H36 together with the restriction of 3636 to 36H3641 forms a group in its own right We typically write 36H G36 Note that the set containing only the identity element 36123e12536 is a trivial subgroup of 36G36 Furthermore 36G36 itself is a subgroup of 36G36 Example Consider the symmetric group of real bijections under function composition mentioned earlier Then the set of linear functions with nonzero coefficients 36123x mx mid minmathbf123R125123012512536 is a subgroup In general a subgroup of a symmetric group is called a permutation group Cosets Suppose 36G36 is a group and 36H36 is a subgroup Then a left coset of 36H36 in 36G36 is a set 36gH 61 123gh mid hin H12536 where 36g36 is some 40fixed41 element of 36G36 This particular coset is called the left coset of 36H36 in 36G36 with respect to 36g36 Similarly we can defined a right coset of 36H36 in 36G36 as a set 36Hg 61 123hg mid hin H12536 Recall that in MATH 146 we defined a coset of a vector space 36W36 in 36V36 in a similar fashion with vector addition replacing the associative binary operation One difference is that because the associative binary operation is not necessarily commutative the left and right cosets may differ It is often more useful when the left and right cosets of 36H36 in 36G36 happen to be the same cosets 40This is the case for instance in linear algebra41 When 36gH 61 Hg36 for all 36gin G36 then we say that 36H36 is a normal subgroup of 36G36 Quotient Groups Note that it is possible to intutively understand a coset of 36H36 in 36G36 to be some ltqgttranslatedltqgt copy of 36H36 in 36G36 Cosets of 36H36 in 36G36 with respect to two distinct elements 36g36 may indeed still be the same coset Let 36G H36 40pronounced ltqgt36G36 modulo 36H36ltqgt41 be the set of cosets of 36H36 in 36G36 Although we will not prove it it is straightforward to show that any two cosets are either disjoint or entirely coincident I quote the following lede from the Wikipedia article on quotient groups as an alternative way of thinking about quotient groups A quotient group or factor group is a mathematical group obtained by aggregating similar elements of a larger group using an equivalence relation that preserves the group structure As an example consider the group of integers under addition and the group of even integers under addition 40we will call these groups 36mathbf123Z12536 and 362mathbf123Z12536 respectively41 362mathbf123Z12536 is automatically a normal subgroup of 36mathbf123Z12536 because the group operation is additive 40ie commutative41 Then the cosets of 362mathbf123Z12536 in 36mathbf123Z12536 are 36mathbf123Z12536 and 36mathbf123Z12543136 the set of even integers and the set of odd integers The quotient group 36mathbf123Z1252mathbf123Z12536 is therefore 36mathbf123Z1252mathbf123Z125 61 1232mathbf123Z125 2mathbf123Z12543112536 Note that this set is naturally isomorphic to the set of booleans 36mathbf123Z1252 61 1230 112536 We can define an epimorphism 36 Gto GH36 sending every element of 36G36 to the coset of 36H36 in 36G36 it belongs to Such an epimorphism is typically called the canonical projection from 36G36 to 36GH36 First Isomorphism Theorem Let 36G36 and 36H36 be groups and 36f Gto H36 be a homomorphism Then 36operatorname123kernel12540f4136 is a normal subgroup of 36G36 36operatorname123image12540f4136 is a subgroup of 36H36 36operatorname123image12540f4136 is isomorphic to 36Goperatorname123kernel12540f4136 Example Let 36mathbf123R125setminus123012536 denote the group of real numbers except zero under multiplication Let 36mathsf123GL12540n mathbf123R1254136 40the general linear group41 denote the group of invertible 36ntimes n36 real matrices under multiplication Then note by properties of the determinant that the determinant 36operatorname123det12536 is a homomorphism between 36mathsf123GL12540n mathbf123R1254136 and 36mathbf123R125setminus123012536 Let 36mathsf123SL12540n mathbf123R1254136 40the special linear group41 denote the group of 36ntimes n36 real matrices with determinant 36136 under multiplication Then by the first isomorphism theorem the quotient group 36mathsf123GL12540n mathbf123R12541 mathsf123SL12540n mathbf123R1254136 is isomorphic to 36mathbf123R125setminus123012536 40Note that in this case since the identity element is 36136 therefore 36mathsf123SL12540n mathbf123R1254136 is precisely the kernel of the 36operatorname123det12536 morphism41 Finite Groups and Lagranges Theorem An important class of groups is the class of groups with finitely many elements known as finite groups Define the order of a finite group to be the number of elements it contains If 36H36 is a subgroup of 36G36 then defined the index 3691G H9336 to be the number of left cosets of 36H36 in 36G36 Then there is an important result known as Lagranges Theorem 3691G H93 61 frac123G125123H12536 In particular for finite group 36G36 and normal subgroup 36H36 we have 36G H 61 frac123G125123H12536 which emphasizes that the quotient group is indeed as its name would suggest a generalization of division
