# Math Seminar

A simple static site for an informal math seminar series. Parts are still
generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), but the long-term goal is to
migrate entirely to Htsx.

## To deploy:
Generate the site:
`hugo --theme=seminar`

Push the generated `public` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.

# Editing

All the content is stored in the `pages` directory as markdown files.

You can edit them directly on Github, or clone the repository to your computer.
