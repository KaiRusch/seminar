# Mathematics Student Seminars

![](/seminar/seminar.png)

This is the website for the student-run University of Waterloo mathematics
student seminars. We are a group of mathematics and computer science students
who are interested in learning new topics and presenting our new knowledge to
others.

We meet every Friday, generally in MC 4020. See our [FAQ](/seminar/faq) for
frequently asked questions, and the [archive](/seminar/archive) for talks
before todayâ€™s date. To browse talks by topic, see the [tags](/seminar/tags)
page.
