**Note**: This talk is not currently officially scheduled. We would like to
cover it at some point before Akshay’s talk following.

We will cover some ideas from number theory like quadratic reciprocity, Euler’s
totient function, and the Legendre and Jacobi symbols. We will use [Baker,
1984](http://golibgen.io/view.php?id=733865) as a reference.
