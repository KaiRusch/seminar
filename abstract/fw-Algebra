This talk will cover the basics of group theory, focusing especially on
transformation groups, commutator subgroups, and solvable groups. We will
additionally cover some ideas from number theory like quadratic reciprocity,
Eulerâ€™s totient function, and the Legendre and Jacobi symbols. Please message
me in advance if there are any other subjects in particular that you would like
me to discuss.
