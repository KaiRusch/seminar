Abstract The first part of this talk will be concerned with a brief introduction to measure theory. We will answer questions such a: How do we measure sets? Can every set be measured?
The second part of this talk will be the construction of the Lebesgue integral along with basic properties of the Lebesgue integral, along with comparisons to Riemann integration as we go.</p>

        <p> This talk, delivered by Luthfi Mawarid was held on Friday October 21, 2016 in MC 4020.
Abstract This talk will cover the very basics of Category Theory, motivated by simple examples using the category of sets. I will then introduce some applications to other areas of mathematics, such as linear algebra and programming language theory.
Outline  Introduction &#40;definition of categories - objects, morphisms, with composition and identity&#41;  Examples with categories of sets &#40;to illustrate compositions, retractions and sections, isomorphisms, other interesting morphisms, etc&#41;  Notion of initial, terminal and zero objects  Categories of categories, locally small categories, functors &#40;and some interesting ones&#41;, categorical equivalence  Applications - linear algebra  Applications - CS, Haskell, programming language theory    </p>

        <p> This talk, delivered by Nikita Kapustin was held on Friday October 14, 2016 in MC 5479.
Abstract I&#39;ll be talking about how to use basic types like sets and functions to construct other types and use them to represent objects.

        <p>This talk, delivered by Sidhant Saraogi was held on Friday October 14, 2016 in MC 5479.
Abstract I will try to provide a brief introduction to Information Theory working towards motivating Shannon&#39;s Source Coding Theorem. We will use rather simple examples &#40;for e.g. Repetition Codes&#41; to explain the idea of noisy channels and similarly simple examples to explain the idea behind the theorem and eventually try to prove it for a rather specific example.</p>

        <p>This talk, delivered by Zouhaier Ferchiou was held on Wednesday October 12, 2016 in MC 4020.
Abstract This talk will cover the basics of dealing with graphs with an infinite number of verticies, focusing mostly on countably many verticies.
I will cover basic definitions of graph theory, Menger&#39;s theorem &#40;Only 1 version, don&#39;t worry&#41;, trees, girths and chromatic numbers briefly for people not familiar with the terms. We will then jump into the sweet stuff, defining teeth and spines, local infinity, rays.</p>

        <p>This talk, delivered by Online Reference was held on Wednesday October 12, 2016 in Online.
Abstract Note: This talk is not currently officially scheduled. We would like to cover it at some point before Akshay’s talk following.
We will cover some ideas from number theory like quadratic reciprocity, Euler’s totient function, and the Legendre and Jacobi symbols. We will use Baker, 1984 as a reference.

        <p> This talk, delivered by Felix Bauckholt was held on Wednesday October 12, 2016 in MC 4020.
Abstract In this talk, I will try to explain what ultrafilters are. I will do this by presenting a few motivating examples, and also some examples that, even if they don&#39;t motivate anything, are just really cool.

        <p>This talk, delivered by Fengyang Wang was held on Wednesday October 12, 2016 in MC 4020.
Abstract This talk will cover the basics of group theory. There are no official prerequisites for this talk, but MATH 145 and MATH 146 are an asset. The group theory part of the talk will mostly be based on Alekseev, 2004, specifically sections 1.1 &#40;motivation&#41;, 1.2 &#40;transformation groups&#41;, 1.5, 1.9, and 1.13 &#40;various morphisms&#41;, and 1.</p>
