HTMLCSS availableFonts TeX Topic Speaker Location Time Talks on Wednesday October 12 2016 Primer on Algebra and Number Theory Fengyang Wang MC 4020 1730 This talk will cover the basics of group theory focusing especially on transformation groups commutator subgroups and solvable groups We will additionally cover some ideas from number theory like quadratic reciprocity Eulers totient function and the Legendre and Jacobi symbols There are no official prerequisites for this talk but MATH 145 and MATH 146 are an asset The group theory part of the talk will mostly be based on Alekseev 2004 specifically sections 11 40motivation41 12 40transformation groups41 15 19 and 113 40various morphisms41 111 40quotient groups41 112 40commutator subgroups41 and 114 40solvable groups41 The number theory part of the talk will use Baker 1984 as a reference Due to time constraints it is inevitable that some content must be rushed I will not go over proofs and derivations in full rigour and I highly advise studying the reference material after the talk to catch up on what you may have missed Please message me in advance if there are any other subjects in particular that you would like me to discuss AbelRuffini Theorem Akshay Tiwary MC 4020 1830 The AbelRuffini Theorem is a famous result that not all polynomials with degree five or greater admit roots that can be described with only the elementary functions and radicals This talk will prove the AbelRuffini through elementary means Ultrafilters Felix Bauckholt MC 4020 1930 In this talk I will try to explain what ultrafilters are I will do this by presenting a few motivating examples and also some examples that even if they don39t motivate anything are just really cool Talks on Friday October 14 2016 Information Theory Sidhant Saraogi MC 5479 1730 Required reading Stirlings Approximation 91PDF93 Types and ObjectOriented Programming Nikita Kapustin MC 5479 1830 Talks on Friday October 21 2016 Category Theory Luthfi Mawarid MC 4020 1730 Quantum Computing Michael Pang MC 4020 1830 Talks on Friday October 28 2016 Hacking Rolina Wu MC 4020 1730 Integration Gregory Patchell MC 4020 1830 Introduce the ideas that lead to the Lebesgue definition of the integral stressing on understanding rather than rigourous details Talks on Friday November 4 2016 Game Theory Koosha Totonchi MC 4020 1730 Symmetric Groups Representation Theory and Young Tableaux Randy Lin MC 4020 1830 Talks on Friday November 11 2016 Graphs Surfaces and Homology Kai Rsch MC 4020 1730 Random Graphs and Complex Networks Freida Rong MC 4020 1830 Talks on Friday November 18 2016 Hypercomplex Numbers Fengyang Wang MC 4020 1730 We all know that 36mathrm123i125261136 But what if it werent This talk explores generalizations of the complex numbers Elliptic Curves and Modular Forms Akshay Tiwary MC 4020 1830 40Preliminary41 Ill talk about these at a rough level and try to explain a tiny bit about how these relate to Fermats Last Theorem Talks on
